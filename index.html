        <div class="card-body">
          <p class="card-text"><a href="https://bikeshare.metro.net/" target="_blank">Los Angeles' Metro Bike Share program</a> started in July of 2016.  The data provided is very detailed.  The data used for this analysis is the date, start and end times, and passholder type.  Data such as ride duration, starting and ending stations, and trip route category invites further analysis.  At the time of this study, data after 3/31/2018 was not available.<br><br>

          The question to answer was: who is riding the bikes?  It was decided to see if we could determine if there were more tourists or commuters riding the bikes.<br><br>

          The first step taken was to plot the total trips taken for each month (21 contiguous months).  This gave us an overall usage picture.  More details can be found on the <a href="https://sqweets.github.io/per-month.html">"Rides per Month"</a> page.<br><br>

          Next, the rides were plotted per day of the week.  The totals for each quarter of data was used.  We were looking mostly for a difference between the weekdays and the weekends.  More details can be found on the <a href="https://sqweets.github.io/time-of-day.html">"Rides per Time of Day"</a> page.<br><br>

          Determining what time of day had the most recorded rides was examined next.  Each quarter of ride totals were plotted by the day of the week.  These results were surprising.  More details can be found on the <a href="https://sqweets.github.io/day-of-week.html">"Rides per Day of the Week"</a> page.<br><br>

          The final plot is of the passholder types used per month.  This give a picture of how the ride was paid for.  There are walkups, one day passes, monthly passes and flex passes (yearly, used on all transit).  The one day pass was added in the last quarter of 2017.  More details can be found on the <a href="https://sqweets.github.io/payment-plot.html">"Payment Types per Months"</a> page.<br><br>

          Further Study: Students were not considered in the initial analysis and would likely be major riders if the bikes are near any colleges/universities.  The ride durations and stations used (and location) could uncover more about the ridership.  In addition, the second quarter of 2018 data is now available.<br><br>

          Changes since this study was completed:  The price to ride for 30 minutes (the minimum ride) was halved to $1.75.  This brought the service in line with the other transit options in the area.  Docking stations were added. Also, the service now offers group/bulk rates for single ride passes, targeting hotels tour groups, apartment buildings, conventions, and conferences.
